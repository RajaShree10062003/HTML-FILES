Hello everyone!
To upgrade my skills while learning HTML, I have created this application form.
The original form can be taken from the official website of TMB bank. This is only for the educational purpose no other motive to be subjected for security issues.

The form is created only using HTML and CSS only.
By using many ways this project can be build:
  1. By using Tables in HTML and CSS.
  2. By using <form> tag with various <input> fields.

Thank you for looking into this form! Happy day.
If you have any doubts you can mail me at rajashreecsetec20@gmail.com
